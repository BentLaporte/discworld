MUSHclient plugins for Discworld Mud made by Tetraam (in-game name)

BeserkStats.xml is a plugin that helps with managing the 'berserk' command. Here are some of the features: -keeps track of the remaining berserk duration. -highlights berserk's messages in RED. -allows custom sounds for entering berserk, leaving berserk, recovering physical and spiritual exhaustion.

Future features: -allow "click and play" by eliminating the need to set a path to the wavs folder by adding relative pathing. -store the user's tactics bonus as a variable between berserk. This will increase the speed of the plugin. -add visual aids like quow's bar.

IMPORTANT if you want to run this plugin you'll have to modify the absolute path to the wavs folder.
